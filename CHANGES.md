# Changes

## v1.1 (dev)

* Add ability to create executor plugins
* Add ability to specify which executor (including multiple executors) to use by default and on a test-specific basis
* Add experimental support for [Miniwdl](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/miniwdl) executor
* Swtich from delegator.py to [subby](https://github.com/jdidion/subby) for executing subprocesses
* Fixes for path finding - test data and imports are now resolved correctly in the cases of "standard" project setups
* Tests are isolated from any local configuration
* Added ability to specify custom URL scheme handlers, and added a handler for files hosted on DNAnexus
* Fixed the makefile to correctly run all the intended targets
* Lots of fixes and improvements to VCF and BAM comparison (see updated docs)
* Add ability to modify comparison options on DataFiles (set_compare_opts method)
* Add support for arbitrary objects in test_data.json
* Improve comparison of expected to actual values, including support for None, dict, and list values
* Add support for comparing gzipped files, using [xphyle](https://github.com/jdidion/xphyle) to detect file format
* Improve assertion error messages
* Add json data type and add ability to localize dict contents as JS

## v1.0.1 (2019.08.28)

* Workflow files are first searched in the current test context directory, so it is no longer necessary to pass a relative path from the project root to workflow_runner
* Defined the concept of a module root, which is the first directory (starting from the test context directory) up that contains a "tests" folder
    * WDL files under the current module root are imported by default if an import_paths.txt file is not specified
    * The workflow_data_descriptor_file fixture is updated to correctly look for test_data.json in the tests/ directory of the current module
* Complex workflow inputs are now serialized properly, which ensures that data files in arrays or dicts are localized

## v1.0.0 (2019.08.23)

* First public release of pytest-wdl
